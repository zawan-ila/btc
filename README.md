# btc
btc is an implementation of a subset of the BitTorrent protocol to allow us to download torrent files. It is mainly written for learning purposes.

## Usage
`python main.py <path to torrent file>`

## ToDo
Right now the downloads proceed real slow. For example, downloading a one GB file took us five and a half hours. Fix This.
